# A Deep Dive Into The Causes and Results of Poor Sleep

## Context 
As a health insurance company, we have noticed a rise in sleep disorders leading to increased expenditure. We need to causes and trends to try reduce this expenditure.

## Expected Outcomes
- Identify trends in sleep disorders
- Identify causes of sleep disorders
- Create a dashboard summarising findings
- Present findings to stakeholders

## Tools Used
- PowerBI
- DAX
- Python

## Output
See file named "Sleep EDA".

## Conclusions
- High BMI is correlated with sleep disorders
- More steps were correlated with a lower weight
- Sleep disorders are more common later in life and in women
- Occupation correlated with the amount of sleep and the likelihood of a sleep disorder

## Recommendations
- Create incentives to lose weight. Incentives that target increasing daily step count are likely more effective than those that promote increased physical activity
- Consider revisiting prices for women and those who are older
- Create awareness campaigns targeted at people with occupations known to decrease the amount of sleep and increase the likelihood of a sleep disorder, so that they are more likely to take mitigating steps such as limiting stimulants in the afternoon
